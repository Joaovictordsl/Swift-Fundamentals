<h1>Delegate Design Pattern</h1>

<h2>It enables a class or structure to delegate some of its responsibilities to another instance, often referred to as a "delegate."</h2>

In the delegate pattern, two objects are involved: the delegating object and the delegate. The delegating object contains a reference to the delegate, and it calls methods on the delegate to notify it of certain events or to request specific actions. This allows for a clean separation of concerns and promotes modularity in the codebase.

<h2>Protocol Definition:</h2>

Define a protocol that declares the methods that the delegate can implement. This protocol serves as a contract, specifying the behavior that the delegate must adhere to.
```swift
protocol MyDelegate: class {
    func didReceiveData(data: String)
    func didFailWithError(error: Error)
}
```

<h2>Delegate Property:</h2>

Declare a delegate property in the delegating class, typically using the protocol as the type.
```swift
class MyDelegatingClass {
    weak var delegate: MyDelegate?
    
    func processData() {
        // Process data and notify the delegate
        if dataProcessingSuccessful {
            delegate?.didReceiveData(data: "Processed data")
        } else {
            delegate?.didFailWithError(error: processingError)
        }
    }
}
```

<h2>Delegate Implementation:</h2>

Implement the delegate methods in the class or structure that conforms to the delegate protocol.
```swift
class MyDelegateImplementation: MyDelegate {
    func didReceiveData(data: String) {
        print("Received data: \(data)")
    }
    
    func didFailWithError(error: Error) {
        print("Error occurred: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}
```
