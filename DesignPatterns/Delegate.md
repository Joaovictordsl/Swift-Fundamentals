<h1>Delegate Design Pattern</h1>

<h2>It enables a class or structure to delegate some of its responsibilities to another instance, often referred to as a "delegate."</h2>

In the delegate pattern, two objects are involved: the delegating object and the delegate. The delegating object contains a reference to the delegate, and it calls methods on the delegate to notify it of certain events or to request specific actions. This allows for a clean separation of concerns and promotes modularity in the codebase.
