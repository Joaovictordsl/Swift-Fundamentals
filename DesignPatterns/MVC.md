<h1>MVC Design Pattern</h1>

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern is a widely used architectural pattern in Swift for organizing and structuring code in an application. It separates an application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller, each having distinct responsibilities.

Here's a brief summary of the MVC design pattern and an example:

Model:

Represents the application's data and business logic.
Responsible for retrieving, processing, and storing data.
Should not be directly aware of the user interface.
View:

Displays the data from the Model to the user.
Handles user interface elements and user interactions.
Does not contain application logic; it delegates this to the Controller.
Controller:

Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.
Receives user input from the View, processes it, and updates the Model accordingly.
Updates the View with changes in the Model.
Example in Swift:

Let's consider a simple example of a to-do list application:

```swift
// Model
struct Todo {
    var title: String
    var isCompleted: Bool
}

// View
class TodoView: UIView {
    // Display logic, UI elements, and user interactions
    var titleLabel: UILabel
    var completionButton: UIButton
    
    // ...
}

// Controller
class TodoViewController: UIViewController {
    var todo: Todo
    var todoView: TodoView

    init(todo: Todo) {
        self.todo = todo
        self.todoView = TodoView()
        super.init(nibName: nil, bundle: nil)
        setupUI()
    }

    func setupUI() {
        // Configure UI elements based on the Todo model
        todoView.titleLabel.text = todo.title
        todoView.completionButton.isSelected = todo.isCompleted
        todoView.completionButton.addTarget(self, action: #selector(completionButtonTapped), for: .touchUpInside)
        view.addSubview(todoView)
    }

    @objc func completionButtonTapped() {
        // Handle user interaction and update the Model
        todo.isCompleted.toggle()
        todoView.completionButton.isSelected = todo.isCompleted
    }
}
```
