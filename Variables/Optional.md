<h1>Swift Optionals</h1>

An optional in Swift is a type that represents either a wrapped value or nil.
  
2. **Syntax**: It's denoted by appending a "?" after the type, indicating the possibility of the value being absent.

3. **Purpose**: Optionals are used to handle situations where a value might be missing, preventing runtime errors caused by accessing nil values.

4. **Safety**: They are a key feature in Swift's type system, promoting safety and clarity in code by explicitly stating when a value may or may not exist.

5. **Usage**: Optionals are extensively used in Swift programming, particularly in scenarios where values may be optional, such as when dealing with user input, network requests, or accessing elements in collections.
