Collections and Data Structures:

Arrays, Dictionaries, Sets, and their operations.
Working with complex data structures.

<h2>Functions and Closures:</h2>

Definition and usage of functions.
Introduction to closures and their role in Swift.

<h2>Object-Oriented Programming in Swift:</h2>

Classes, structures, and enumerations.
Properties, methods, and initializers.
